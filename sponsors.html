		<h2 class="grid-100">Overview</h2>
		<p class="grid-100">
			UBC Launchpad is a Engineering Design Team at UBC that focuses on build web and mobile apps using proper Software Engineering techniques. We are honing and training the next generation of developers at UBC while also teaching students important soft skills needed in order to work on a team.

			Our student team is broken up into 5 subteams: Django, Javascript, iOS, Android and UX. Each team works on its own project and follows a biyearly release cycle for each app.

			In addition to student teams, UBC Launchpad also provides workshops, training and resources to students and professionals. With our deep talent pool we have some of the best instructors and developers in UBC. 
		</p>
		<h2 class="grid-100" id="why-sponsor">Why Sponsor</h2>
		<p class="grid-100">
			UBC Launchpad is a great way to tap into vetted and talented developers for your company. We prescreen each team member with rigourous technical interview as well as a small project on the platform of their chosen team, so you can be sure that each an every team member is familiar with their own team's stack. 

			With our newsletter, workshops and events, UBC Launchpad is also a great way to engage the broader developer community and provides many events and venues to search for talented developers outside of our teams. As the only software-focused student team in UBC, our events are well regarded and well known across UBC's developer community.

			UBC Launchpad is also a great way to connect with potential hires and build a relationship with them. This allows you to increase referrals and tap into a pre-existing talent pool without running your own events or programs.
		</p>
		<h2 class="grid-100" id="sponsor-tips">Get the most out of your sponsorship:</h2>
		<h3 class="grid-100">Send Company Swag</h3>
		<p class="grid-100">
			Sending branded stickers, T-shirts, water bottles, etc., is a great way for sponsors to promote their company brand through passive advertising. Hackers love swag, so the more you give us/bring to our events, the more successful your sponsorship dd`will be!
		</p>
		<h3 class="grid-100">Send Engineers</h3>
		<p class="grid-100">
			Sending engineers is a surefire way to connect hackers with your company. Sending technical employees to give technical talks or workshops is a great way to connect with hackers and explain what your product is about. This is a surefire way to get the attention of the best hackers at our events and in our network. This is a great way for you to connect with your audience and increase your recruitment/promotion potential!
		</p>
		<h3 class="grid-100">Bring your API or Product</h3>
		<p class="grid-100">
			You can get real eyeballs in front of your product with a sweet demo. Engineers will appreciate your live demo and will be much more likely to use your product. This is also a great way to get invaluable evaluation of your product at the alpha stage, from some of the top hackers in Canada and the US.
