          Cumulus is a cryptocurrency that allows users to send and receive tokens on a P2P network or "mine" on the network to create
          tokens for themselves. Cumulus reimagines the proof-of-work mechanism used by Bitcoin and many other major cryptocurrencies
          to put coin mining computation time to good use. The Cumulus node client is built using Go.

          drivers, Driver generates an efficient route to each destination. Driver is built using Java and Firebase.

    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p class="large">
      UBC Launch Pad is a student-run software engineering team devoted to building software projects in a collaborative and professional
      environment.
      <br /> Our primary objective is to be the best space at UBC for students to meet other tech enthusiasts, build projects in
      a team setting, gain experience with professional development tools and principles, and share their knowledge with
      others. We form teams based on common interests and project ideas of our own choosing, and hack on our projects to
      completion! We are also lucky enough to have sponsors which help provide our teams with necessary resources, like servers,
      to help us achieve our goals.

          Launch Pad provides a unique opportunity for UBC students to gain software design and development experience in an environment
          where they are not pressured for time and have the support of their peers to learn and bring their own ideas to
          the table. Moreover, many of the skills our members acquire and the projects they work on prove to be indispensible
          during the job application process, both for co-op terms and after graduation. We have sponsors provide who us
          with valueable resources like cloud services, and we ensure that each team has a great technical lead who will
          support the growth of our junior members. The feedback from our members on their tech leads has been overwhelmingly
          positive:
          <br />
          <br />
          <em>
            "Just really want to thank the team members for teaching me so much, extremely meaningful for me."
            <br /> "Chad and Kevin were very knowledgeable in ML Topics, as well as CS in general. Kevin was a great help with
            information about finding internships as well."
            <br /> "Friendly, patient, and helpful! "

          Launch Pad recruits new members at the beginning of each semester. At the beginning of a recruiting period we post our application
          form on our website and share it through relevant social media. Once the application deadline has passed, we schedule
          interviews with applicants. Interviews are generally around 20 minutes and entail a few experiential questions
          (tell us about your projects and passions), two short-answer technical questions depending on your platform of
          choice, and a coding question. After interviews have been completed we notify all applicants (regardless of whether
          or not they were selected), and schedule onboarding with new members.

          We want the club to be useful for all our members, which means people need to be able to build projects and acquire new knowledge
          and skills. After doing this for a few years, we’ve found that building projects at a reasonable pace requires
          one or two more experienced members per team who can lead the way and act as a resource for folks who may not have
          as much experience. The number of people we can accept into the club is limited by the number of teams, which is
          limited by how many people are capable and interested in being a team lead. It would be fantastic if we could accept
          everyone who wanted to join, but at the moment we can’t. One of our goals going forward is to be able to accept
          more members while still maintaining a good experience for everyone in the club.

          Launch Pad projects are all team projects, and as a part of a team, you will need to contribute in order to advance both
          your team's project, and your own skills. Thus, you will be expected to attend meetings every Saturday from 11am
          to 3pm where you will discuss the week's goals with your team and decide what tasks need to be done. You will also
          be expected to complete or make progress on whatever task is assigned to you that week (or let your team lead know
          a week in advance if you have to miss a meeting or are too busy to complete a ticket), and to be available on Slack
          throughout the week.
