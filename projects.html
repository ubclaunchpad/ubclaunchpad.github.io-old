				<h1>MINUTES</h1>
				<h2>September 2017 - May 2018</h2>
				<p>
					Minutes is a small Python library for speaker classification from audio data. It uses a technique called transfer learning to reduce the time cost of training models on new audio datasets. Embedded in Minutes is a model trained on hundreds of hours of read english text, and the appropriate tools to port this classifier to predict on new voices.
				</p>
				<p>
					Minutes is built on Keras running on top of TensorFlow.

				<h1>EAT</h1>
				<h2>September 2017 - May 2018</h2>
				<p>
					Figuring out where and what to eat when you're out with your friends or family can be a daunting task. Eat is an application built to help you decide on a restaurant in your area that accommodates everyone's preferences. Our algorithm suggests places to eat based the group's location, dietary restrictions, price range, and intended meal time. After each person in the group as voted on the suggested restaurants the app selects the optimal restaurant for the group.
				</p>
				<p>
					Eat was built for iOS using Swift and Objective-C.

				<h1>DRIVER</h1>
				<h2>May 2016 - Septemper 2017</h2>
				<p>
					Driver is a ride-sharing app for Android that ensures everyone gets home safely.
					Users provide their destination address and Driver intelligently matches passengers to drivers to minimize driving time.
					When passengers are matched to drivers, Driver generates and displays an efficient route to each passenger's destination.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Driver app is built with Java and leverages a Firebase backend.
					Because of this design, the algorithm matching passengers to drivers is distributed across devices without compromising battery life.

				<h1>KAGGLE COMPETITION</h1>
				<h2>January 2017 - May 2017</h2>
				<p>
					Launch Pad's Machine Learning team participated in the annual Data Science Bowl, hosted by Kaggle.com.
					The task was to predict presence of lung cancer in CT scans in order to create a model for early lung cancer detection.
					In the United States, lung cancer affects 225,000 people every year, and accounts for $12 billion in health care costs.
				</p>
				<p>
					The team used several deep learning techniques including convolutional neural networks with several different architectures.
					Our approach placed in the top 15% of teams.
